## Overview
This is a newsletter sign up form that accepts user email and shows a success message when the correct email format is entered. It was built using react and vite.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
Firstly, I go through the designs and determine what decisions I should make in development. I write these decisions down in a note from simplest to most difficult. An example will be whether to use CSS grids or flexbox or validate using regex for email validation or the in-built HTML form validation, getting a clear view of these decision help to make work easier and faster.
Secondly, I use React JS becuase it is Javascript most common framework which gives me access to a lot of information in case any anything goes wrongly.
Thirdly, I write most of the required JSX and CSS and include each feature from easiest to most difficult. 


### Built with

- React JS
- Vite
- CSS flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This section helped me understand how to connect different pages in a React appliaction using the react router dom and I
also got more understanding on how to validate emails using regex.
